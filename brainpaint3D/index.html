          BrainPaint is a project about turning your thoughts into reality. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          Generate art by thinking about a goal or a dream you want to achieve. Watch your brain activity reflect your thoughts and change to high theta, a state associated with daydreaming, intuition and creativity.

          By visualizing your thoughts, the piece serves as a call-to-action to create your dreams. That anyone can create what's on their mind. 
        </p>  
        <p>  
          This is the first piece in a series of explorations on brain art interfaces, enabling anyone to interact with art through their minds.
