      BrainPaint is a project about turning your thoughts into reality. 

      Generate art by thinking about a goal or a dream you want to achieve. Watch your brain activity reflect your thoughts and change to high theta, a state associated with daydreaming, intuition and creativity.

      By visualizing your thoughts, the piece serves as a call-to-action to create your dreams. That anyone can create what's on their mind.
