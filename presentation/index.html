                        The participant will think of a dream they want to achieve. That thought will manifest into a visual object that will be added into a scene with others' thought-generated objects. This collection, a tangible representation of thoughts, becomes our story.

                    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Driven by her intrigue for ways of leveraging technology to reflect the human thought process. Fueled by her passion to enable others to act on their dreams. Grace Ng created BrainPaint as a visual feedback loop for positive thinking. To highlight the power of imagination and encourage others to turn their thoughts into reality. Inspired by the word "history", which, if broken down, becomes "his story", an alienating term that can be made more inclusive. Our story. What would our story be if everyone contributed their dreams? Your thoughts are real. They have meaning. Stop keeping thoughts to yourself and turn them into action.
